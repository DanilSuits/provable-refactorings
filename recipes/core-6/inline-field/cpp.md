# Inline Field

Not entirely clear what an inlined field looks like, particularly when it is shared between methods. Perhaps something like currying? Dunno.

Or perhaps this recipe is only for uses when the field is only used in one mehtod, or can be passed into that one method, or not modified after a certain point in time, or the like.
